This [lesson](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tpk9WVl4q4v6JP1Ndf5TPDTpPJg6xt5m/view) aims to explore the use of ultrasonic sensors. This lesson makes use of our work from lesson one. When we move our hand closer to the ultrasonic sensor, an LED will glow brighter. We also look at the physics behind the code, noting how we use the speed of sound and the time it takes for the pulse to return to calculate the distance of an object from the sensor.
