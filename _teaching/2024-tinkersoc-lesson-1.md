This [lesson](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_mnXeEv4VZOmMrGaFHMhLB0Mk78D5Qt/view) aims to teach the electronic equivalent of "hello world" -- blinky. We start with the basics - installing the IDE and connecting the ESP32 to the computer. We then explore the syntax and layout of a C++ program, and how to build a basic circuit to blink our LED.
