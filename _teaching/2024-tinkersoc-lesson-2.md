This [lesson](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Se87Rq-poKUxeGRTk1zavvhxGhntYUW3/view) aims to move a servo with the push of a button. We mostly focus on controlling the servos through code. As an extension, we touch on the theory behind servo control - PWM. For fun, I often bring in my oscilloscope for this class. Doing so provides a visual for all the theory, but really it is so I can show off [oscilloscope music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KDekS4YUy4). It's a big hit, and my favourite part of the class.
